## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, part 1 

I liked this lab because it was one of the early labs we did in this course, and I felt like it was a cool one to do because of the information it would output. Seeing your BMR was interesting to me because it would be a different output depending on the person who input their age, weight, and height. The coding behind this one was fun because we followed the BMR formula for both male and female, this was also the first time we used math in coding so seeing how this info is calculated  by using plus signs and the star sign to multiply while also making a program that can easily tell you your BMR is what made it interesting to me because it was fun in the end seeing my info when I inputted my weight and height. 

 

Lab 4, part 2 

This lab was a fun one for me because it was the first introduction to if else statements and I found this this first starter to these different types of statements was a good way to teach the basics for it. For example, in the coding it asks for a player to enter a secret number and then for another to enter their guess number, using the if statements to tell if the number matches or doesnâ€™t match which would then lead to another path was very interesting for me to see how it worked, I felt it was a simple yet challenging lab that I could easily understand and follow along with which is what made this lab stand out to me and a bit more memorable. 

 

Lab 6, part 2 

I liked this lab because it made us create a program for a blackjack game which is a game that I am familiar with as well as enjoy playing as well. This lab was interesting to me because it made me think of cards and how to add them differently than what I am used to because of the complexity of the Ace card being either an 11 or a 1. Programming this was an interesting task because figuring out how to make it so the ace will continue to follow the rules of blackjack if it can fit within that 1 or 11 sum was a challenge.
